Basic-Codelab-Compose

Basic project that implements basic Jetpack Compose concepts.

This simple project is aims to apply some basic Compose concepts learned under the scope of a basic codelab from Google. It applies concepts as native composable functions (e.g. Buttons, Texts, Containers, Lazy Containers), animation, states, state hoisting and recomposition, and styling and theming customization.For the organization of the Composable functions, atomic design was implemented.

For the sake of simplicity, the app only shows a list of portuguese football teams, in which each item is an expandable card that shows some basic information about the team.
